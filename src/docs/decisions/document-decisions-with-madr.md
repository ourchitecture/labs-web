# Document important decisions with MADR

## Context and Problem Statement

Important decisions have a context including a history, why a decision had to be made, and the details of how a decision was made. Understanding these decisions and their history can help others to understand the types of important decision considerations that have been made.

## Decision Drivers

-   Improve understanding of important decisions
-   Empower informed decision making

## Considered Options

-   Not documenting decisions
-   Documenting decisions
-   Which tools to use

## Decision Outcome

Document decisions with "Markdown Any Decision Records" (MADR); familiar with it and good enough.

### Consequences

-   Good, because all current developers agree
