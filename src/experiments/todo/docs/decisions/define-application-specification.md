# Application Specification

## Context and Problem Statement

Functional and non-functional requirements will be required to build a basic
"todo" application.

## Considered Options

-   Custom requirements
-   Inherit and customize "todomvc" application specification
-   Inherit and customize "todo-list-app" application specification

## Decision Outcome

To start, this experiment will inherit the "Application Specification" from
the "todomvc" project.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

-   Good, because the experiment can focus on implementation concerns and less
    on creating requirements
